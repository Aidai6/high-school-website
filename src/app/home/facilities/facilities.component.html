      <h3>STEM Clubs</h3>
      <p>Our STEM Clubs are out-of-timetable sessions that enrich and broaden the curriculum, giving our students
        the chance to explore subjects like science, technology, engineering and maths in less formal settings.

      <h3>Physical Activities</h3>
      <p>We strongly believe that physical activities not only benefit their bodies and physiological performances
        but also their mental conditions as well as improving their cognitive performances. Therefore, our school has
        to offer sport activities on our well-equipped tennis, volleyball, football, and basketball playing grounds.</p>

      <h3>Music and Arts</h3>
      <p>Our students are exposed to musical education as well as to creative arts. We believe that playing musical
        instruments,  drawing and painting lets our students explore and expose their creative potentials.
        Therefore, our school provides piano, komuz, vocal singing classes and organizes art exhibitions.</p>
