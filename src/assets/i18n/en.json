Our school is the only independent boarding school in Issyk-Kul Region that serves gifted learners and our students thrive in a setting where like-minded peers engage in learning four languages, developing science and technology projects, and discussing about the origins of humanity. \n\nIn addition to our accelerated, interdisciplinary curriculum that includes science, Kyrgyz, Russian, English, and Turkish languages, physical education, music and arts, we offer chess and debate. We have intensive programs intended to prepare our students for regional and national Olympiads. Those programs let our students make their way to the leading positions and win prestigious academic titles of the country.\n\nOur community also includes hard-working teachers and administrators dedicated to creating an environment where students are challenged to stretch themselves, learn from mistakes, and interact with other intellectually-advanced children in pursuit of higher-level scholarship.
